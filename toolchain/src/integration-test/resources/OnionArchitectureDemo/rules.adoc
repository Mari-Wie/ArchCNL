== Building Block View

This section describes the PlantUML Plugin modules which you will also find in the
Java package structure.

=== Level 1

The following UML package diagram shows the main building blocks of the software system...


==== Architecture Rules

[role="rule"]
Every Aggregate must residein a DomainRing.

[role="rule"]
No Aggregate can use an ApplicationService.
